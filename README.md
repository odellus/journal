journal
=======

A journal utility for Unix systems written in Python which makes use of emacs for editing and couchdb for data persistence.

To install simply type "sudo python setup.py" and all dependencies will be installed automatically.

If one wants to get fancy with the header at the top of each entry, simply edit the file JOURNAL_PREHEADER variable in ~/.twsetup_defaults.py
